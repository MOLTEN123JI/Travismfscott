## Setup Instructions

### 1. Create Telegram Bot

1. Message [@BotFather](https://t.me/botfather) on Telegram
2. Send `/newbot` and follow instructions
3. Save the bot token

### 2. Local Development

```bash
# Clone or download the files
# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Set environment variables
export BOT_TOKEN="your_bot_token_here"
export ADMIN_USER_ID="your_telegram_user_id"  # Optional

# Run the bot
python script.py
```

### 3. Deploy on Render

1. **Create a new Web Service on Render**
2. **Connect your repository** or upload files
3. **Configure environment variables**:
   - `BOT_TOKEN`: Your Telegram bot token
   - `ADMIN_USER_ID`: Your Telegram user ID (optional)
4. **Set build command**: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
5. **Set start command**: `python script.py`
6. **Deploy**

### 4. Get Your Telegram User ID

1. Message [@userinfobot](https://t.me/userinfobot) on Telegram
2. Copy your user ID
3. Contact admin (ID: 6300435094) to get approved, or use `/approve your_user_id` if you're admin

## Usage

1. **Start the bot**: Send `/start` to your bot
2. **Get approved**: Contact admin (ID: 6300435094) to get access
3. **Start an attack**: 
   ```
   /attack 192.168.1.1:8080:60
   ```
   This will send 5000 UDP packets per second to 192.168.1.1:8080 for 60 seconds

4. **Stop attacks**: Use `/stop` to immediately stop all your attacks
5. **Monitor attacks**: Use `/running` to see active attacks
6. **View logs**: Use `/logs` to see recent attack history

### Admin Usage
- **Approve users**: `/approve 123456789` to approve new users
- **Admin panel**: `/admin` to view all users and system status

## Key Improvements

### üöÄ **4x More Powerful DDoS Testing**
- **5000 threads** (upgraded from 1250)
- **Maximum stress testing** for your game servers
- **Higher packet throughput** for better resilience testing

### üõë **Instant Stop Control**

## Safety Notes

‚ö†Ô∏è **Important**: This tool is for testing your own servers only. Using it against systems you don't own is illegal and unethical.

- Only test your own game servers
- Use appropriate attack durations
- Monitor your server resources during testing
- Stop attacks if server becomes unresponsive

## Troubleshooting

### Bot not responding
- Check if BOT_TOKEN is set correctly
- Verify the bot is running (check logs)
- Ensure you're authorized (use `/add` command)

### Attack not starting
- Verify IP address format (e.g., 192.168.1.1)
- Check port number (1-65535)
- Ensure duration is 1-300 seconds
- Check if you're authorized (contact admin: 6300435094)

### Can't stop attacks
- Use `/stop` command to stop all your attacks
- Only stops attacks by your user ID
- Contact admin if you need help stopping other users' attacks

### High CPU usage
- The tool uses 5000 threads which is very CPU intensive
- Monitor system resources during attacks
- Use `/stop` command if system becomes unresponsive
- Consider running on a powerful server for best performance

## Support

1. Check the logs in `ddos_logs.log`
2. Verify all environment variables are set
3. Ensure you're using the correct command format
